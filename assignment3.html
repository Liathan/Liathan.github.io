                    <p>
                        It is possible to visualize the entire maps of Trento city divided per neighborhoods. The total number of neighborhoods is 11. In this first choropleth map we want to display
                        the tree abundance of each neighborhood . Thanks to a green color map (light green to dark green) we can understand in which neighborhood we have the majority of trees. 
                        In the tooltip , there's also the area of each neighborhood. For example , the greatest amount of trees is in the neighborhood called "S.Giuseppe-S.Chiara"

                    <p>
                        This plot is very similar to the one above. It takes in consideration the tree densities for each neighborhood.
                        This type of visualization helps us to compare neighborhoods in terms of sizes thanks to "area" field in the tooltip. 
                        We can see that in small neighborhood, in the centre of Trento,  there's a major concentration of trees.

                    <p>
                        In this plot we want to show the trees' oxygen production for each neighborhood. But in this case we are using a different kind of color map that goes starting from 0 to max of total
                        oxygen production values (white to dark blue). This plot is correlated to the others because neighborhoods with a high number of trees have a high value of oxygen production.
                        But in this case the greatest producer of oxygen is "Centro storico piedicastello", even though it has a lower tree abundance than "S.Giuseeppe -S.Chiara". This happens probably becuase in the first
                        neighborhood there are more tree suitable for the oxygen production..

                    <p>
                        Here , we can visualize the density of tree's in Trento's neighborhoods. Each point represents a tree . With this kind of visualization is easier to understand and find the real
                        position of each tree in the city. In addition to this , it is possible to analyze how the trees are grouped inside a neighborhood.

                        This plot is very similar to the one above. It displays the density of trees in Trento's neighborhoods and top 6 species . Each one of the 6 species has a particular visualization color , whereas
                        all the others are all grouped and represented by  grey color.
