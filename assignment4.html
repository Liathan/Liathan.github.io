                    It is possible to visualize the entire maps of Trento city divided per neighborhoods. The total
                    number of neighborhoods is 11. In this first choropleth map we want to display
                    the tree abundance of each neighborhood . Thanks to a green color map (light green to dark green) we
                    can understand in which neighborhood we have the majority of trees.
                    In the tooltip , there's also the area of each neighborhood. For example , the greatest amount of
                    trees is in the neighborhood called "S.Giuseppe-S.Chiara"
                </p>

            <!-- SECOND PLOT - Radarchart -->
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Radarchart</h3>

                <p>
                    This plot is very similar to the one above. It takes in consideration the tree densities for each
                    neighborhood.
                    This type of visualization helps us to compare neighborhoods in terms of sizes thanks to "area"
                    field in the tooltip.
                    We can see that in small neighborhood, in the centre of Trento, there's a major concentration of
                    trees.

            <!-- THIRD PLOT: Ridgeline -->

                <p>
                    In this plot we want to show the trees' oxygen production for each neighborhood. But in this case we
                    are using a different kind of color map that goes starting from 0 to max of total
                    oxygen production values (white to dark blue). This plot is correlated to the others because
                    neighborhoods with a high number of trees have a high value of oxygen production.
                    But in this case the greatest producer of oxygen is "Centro storico piedicastello", even though it
                    has a lower tree abundance than "S.Giuseeppe -S.Chiara". This happens probably becuase in the first
                    neighborhood there are more tree suitable for the oxygen production..
