                        We can visualize the quantity of trees by species thanks to the barchart.
                        Since there are 224 tree species, it is reasonable to view only the 15 most numerous species.

                        Now, let's analyze the amount of trees, taking into consideration the neighborhood in which they are located.
                        The trees that did not belong to the top 5 species were grouped into the <span class="font-italic font-bold">Others</span> category.
                        It's interesting to note that in the most numerous neighborhood, the most numerous tree species is not
                        <span class="font-italic">Celtis australis</span>, even if it is the most numerous species among all the neighborhoods.
                        As we can expect from the nature of the <span class="font-italic">Others</span> class, it is the most numerous in each
                        <span class="font-italic">circoscrizione</span>.
                        <br>Moving the mouse over a specific portion of a bar, we can visualize the exact amount of trees for the selected species in a district.

                        We always analyze the number of trees in the various neighborhoods. The visualization via the small multiple
                        stacked barchart, as it separates the tree types, help us to compare the amounts of a specific tree species with
                        respect to the different districts they belong to. 
                        <br>Moving the mouse over the single bars, we can visualize the exact count of each species in a district.

                    <p>
                        Similarly to the second graph (stacked barchart), we analyze the abundance of the tree species in each neighborhood,
                        but displaying them in percentage terms. In this way, it could be easier to understand the distribution of the species
                        in each <span class="font-italic">circoscrizione</span> respect to the graph before. For example we can look for the 
                        <span class="font-bold">POVO</span> <span class="font-italic">circoscrizione</span>: in the stacked barchart, some
                        tree species are not visible because they are to little in the bar (due to their small amount); instead, they could be
                        appreciable in the percentage stacked barchart, thanks to the visualization using percentages.
                        <br>Moving the mouse over a specific portion of a bar, we can visualize the percentage of a tree species in a district.

                        Always considering the top 5 tree species plus the <span class="font-italic">Others</span> class, now we create a wafflechart
                        for each neighborhood that can be chosen via the drop-down menu. Each piece corresponds to approximately one percentage point.
                        <br>Moving the mouse over the single cell of the wafflechart, we can visualize the exact percentage of each species, highlighting
