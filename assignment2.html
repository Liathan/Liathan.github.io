                        Considering the same measurements saw before, now we visualize the boxplots of the top 5 tree species.
                        Thanks to boxplots, we can display some descriptive statistical informations like the median, the maximimum,
                        the minimum, and the quartiles of each distribution. Potentials outliers are plotted as individual points.
                        For example, looking at the height, we can instantly see that <span class="font-italic">Platanus x hispanica</span>
                        species is usually higher with respect to the other species, and more spread, lookind at the IQR.

                        For the top 6 most populated tree species, we display a scatterplot having on the x axis the size of trees, like
                        the height, diameter, canopy size, and leaf area, and and on the y axis the kilograms of CO&#8322; absorbed in a year.
                        We want to discover possible correlations between these variables.
                        <br>Moving the mouse over the single data-point, we can visualize the exact value of the selected measure and the amount of CO&#8322;
