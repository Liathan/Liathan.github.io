                The trees represent one of the first places of natural shelter that are sought outdoors in hot weather,
                or even a meeting point for young and old.
                Their growth and protection are of fundamental importance for the well-being of man and the territory.
                There are numerous local authorities that are particularly active in emphasizing the importance of
                planting more and more trees, especially in cities.
                They bring numerous benefits that are easily received by each of us: benefits both on the environmental
                front, such as the reduction of temperatures, of particulate matter (PM 2.5), and the drainage of the
                land, and on the ornamental front, of beautification of the city.
                There is also a kind of flip side, where branches, or sometimes whole trees, fall to the ground, roots
                breaking sidewalks, or leaves on sidewalks in the fall that could cause people to slip.
                But these negative aspects can all be limited by proper care and monitoring of the trees themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main objective of this project will be to understand which species are the most widespread, those
                that bring greater benefits and how they are arranged in the territory of the municipality of Trento.
                To do this, we will use a set of data provided in open-source mode on GitHub (<a
                    href="https://github.com/Jeko83/">TrentoTreeMap Project</a>), which we will analyze to extrapolate
                all the information necessary to best represent the current situation of the trees in the Trento area.
                We will also aim to estimate in economic terms the benefits brought by the trees in the area, or how
                much man would have to spend to achieve similar goals, also depriving himself of the beauty of different
                tree species.

            <h2>First assignment: <span>Comparing categories</span></h2>
            <p>
                In this first block of visual representations, we want to compare the species of trees that are present
                on Trento's territory.
                We will start showing the top 15 tree species in term of abundance (absolute values). Then, we will pick
                the top 5 ones, plus an
                <span class="font-italic font-bold"

                category which includes all the other tree species, and we will show you their abundance in each

                of Trento's territory. This comparision between circoscrizioni will be carried out using four different

                <li>a <span class="font-bold">percentage stacked barchart</span>, which will use the percent values of

            <h2>Second assignment: <span>Distributions and correlations</span></h2>
            <p>
                Now, we have two different goals: firstly, to understand the distribution of some measurements of the
                trees and, then, to discover
                possible correlations between them and the specific tree species. We will begin showing the distribution
                of some measures (like height,
                diameter, canopy size, and leaf area) on the whole dataset of trees via histrograms. Then, we will
                discover the distribution of those
                variables using boxplots about the top 5 tree species on the territory. After, we will skip to a
                two-dimensional representation using scatterplot:
                we will discover possible correlations between the selected measures for the trees and the kilograms of
                CO&#8322; that they can absorbe during a year.
                The data-points will be colored with respect to the corresponding top 6 tree species. After, we will
                split this scatterplot in a small multiple scatterplot
                where we can find six different plots, one for each of the top 6 classes. At the end, we can find an
                interactive bubblechart in which we compare a measurement
                of the tree with the CO&#8322; that it can absorbe, and with its canopy size.

                In this third block of visual representations , we want to visualize the map of Trento divided by
                neighborhoods , and extract some characteristics for each of them. The fields we want to compare and
                visualize in real time are : Tree abundance , density (the amount of neighborhood space covered by
                trees' canopy cover ) , oxygen production and the trees position.
